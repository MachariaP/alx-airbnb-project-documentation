# Features and Functionalities

## Overview

This document outlines the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend, as part of the Backend Blueprint: Feature Foundations project. The backend provides a RESTful API (with optional GraphQL support) to manage user accounts, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, notifications, and admin functionalities. The features are documented in a Draw.io diagram (`features-and-functionalities.png`) and detailed below, covering core functionalities, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements.

## Visualization

- **Diagram**: `features-and-functionalities.png`
- **Tool**: Draw.io (Diagrams.net)
- **Description**: A hierarchical diagram organizes features into categories (e.g., User Management, Property Listings) with sub-features, inputs, outputs, and constraints. Categories are color-coded boxes, sub-features are ovals, and dependencies are shown with arrows.
